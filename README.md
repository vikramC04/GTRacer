# GTRacer

GTRacer is a python project that leverages the pygame library to create a fun and interactive racing game with the aim of dodging obstacles to increase score. Movement is done using WASD keys.

The project can either be played after downloading `GTRacer` and running the `main.py` file or played directly in the browser at https://vikramc.itch.io/gtracer. This web browser version is
the main.py file converted to a webassembley execution format and hosted on itch.io.
